# Program in Assembly

> Don't overlook the importance of low-level programming!

If you're familiar with a language like C or Java, and don't know how the computer actually works underneath the hood, you should learn to program using **assembly language** to really understand what the computer thinks and acts when it is running a program.

## The First Program

In this simple program: [exit.s](exit.s), we will learn the structure of assembly-language programs, and a few assembly-language commands.

As the file name implies, the program does nothing but exit! Go through the comments in the code to see what really happens when you run the program.
